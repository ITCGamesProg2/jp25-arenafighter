floor always rounds down to the nearest int

floor(wallX / cell width) + (floor (wallY / cell height) * no. of columns)

in practicality: 
	Take an object located at 87, 539, cells are 144 x 90
	The formula in words: floor (objectsX / cell width) + (floor ( objectsY / cell height) * no. of Columns)
	
	So: floor(87 / 144) + (floor ( 539 / 90) * 10)
		floor(0.6) + (floor(5.98) * 10)
		//Remember floor always rounds down to nearest int!!!
		0 + ( 5 * 10 )
		50 <=== This is the cell id!
		
		
In arena fighter, the window will be 1400 x 800, so the cells will be 140 X 80
To redo the formula with my game in mind
	For an object at 260, 600
	floor (260 / 140) + (floor (600 / 80) * 10)
	floor (1.857) + (floor (7.5) * 10)
		1 + 70
		71 = cellId :)
		
		
Cells need a width, height
calculate num of cells using size
Give cells a rectangle shape
give them a semi transparent colouring
		
		 // Draw the grid
        for (int i = 0; i < numCellsX; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < numCellsY; ++j) {
                // Position each cell in the grid
                cell.setPosition(i * cellWidth, j * cellHeight);
                window.draw(cell);
            }
        }
